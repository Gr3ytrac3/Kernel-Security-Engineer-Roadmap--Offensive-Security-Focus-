# 🛡️ Kernel Security Engineer Roadmap (Offensive Security Focus)

Welcome to the **Ultimate Roadmap** to becoming a top-tier **Kernel Security Engineer** with a foundation in **Offensive Security**. This roadmap is structured in **stages**, each building on the previous one.

---

## 🧩 Stage 1: Technical Foundations

### ✅ Must-Have Skills
- Learn Linux & Windows OS internals
- Learn the Linux command line
- Get familiar with Virtualization (VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU)
- Understand Computer Architecture (x86/x64 basics, memory layout)

### 📚 Resources
- [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com)
- [Linux Full Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-tutorial/)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- [Practical Guide to Linux Commands (Book)]

---

## 🔍 Stage 2: Offensive Security Foundations

### 🔧 Skills to Build
- Networking & protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.)
- Information gathering, vulnerability scanning
- Exploiting web apps, buffer overflows, privilege escalation
- Familiarity with Linux/Windows exploitation techniques

### 📦 Tools
- Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, LinPEAS, Nmap, Wireshark

### 🎓 Learning Platforms
- [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [Offensive Security OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)

## 🧠 Stage 3: Deep Dive into Kernel Development

### 📘 What to Learn
- Kernel architecture & subsystems (Linux focus)
- System calls, memory management, I/O, drivers
- Writing kernel modules (LKMs)
- Kernel compilation and debugging

### 🛠 Tools
- GCC, Make, QEMU, GDB, KGDB, Ftrace

### 📚 Resources
- Linux Kernel Development - Robert Love
- Linux Device Drivers - Jonathan Corbet
- [Linux Kernel Newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org)

---

## 💣 Stage 4: Kernel Exploitation & Vulnerability Research

### 📌 Skills
- Use After Free, Race Conditions, Kernel Stack/Heap overflows
- Bypassing SMEP/SMAP, KASLR
- Writing & analyzing kernel exploits
- Rootkit development (educational use only)

### 📘 Resources
- [xairy's Kernel Exploitation Series](https://xairy.io)
- [HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver)
- [Awesome Kernel Exploitation](https://github.com/MaherAzzouzi/Awesome-Kernel-Exploitation)

### 🧪 Practice
- Build your own lab with QEMU snapshots
- Analyze old CVEs, write exploit PoCs
- Fuzz the kernel using [Syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller)

---

## 🛡️ Stage 5: Kernel Hardening & Defense

### 🔐 Focus Areas
- Kernel Security Modules (LSM): SELinux, AppArmor
- Seccomp, Control Groups, Namespaces
- LKRG, grsecurity, KSPP
- System auditing, syscall logging

### 📘 Resources
- [Linux Security Module Framework](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/)
- [AppArmor Documentation](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Documentation)
- [Kernel Lockdown Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-lockdown.html)

---

## 🎯 Stage 6: Specialization Projects (Elite Path)

### 💡 Project Ideas
- Write and document a simple Linux rootkit
- Analyze and mitigate a public kernel CVE
- Develop a security-focused kernel module
- Create a "Hardened Linux Lab" project
- Write technical blog posts or give talks (e.g., Defcon, Kernel Recipes)

---

## 🏅 Certifications (Optional, Prestige Boost)
- OSCP (must-have for offensive foundation)
- OSCE/OSCE3 (advanced exploit development)
- GREM (for reverse engineering malware)
- CRTO (red team operations)

---

## 🧰 Bonus: Tools of the Elite
- Syzkaller, GDB, KGDB, Drgn, Reptoline
- auditd, AppArmor tools, trace-cmd, kprobes
- Custom kernel patches & module debugging tools

---

## 🔥 Final Goal
> Become a Kernel Security Engineer Expert who can **discover, exploit, defend, and harden** operating system kernels — combining the brains of a hacker with the rigor of a low-level developer.

You don’t just find bugs — you know how they’re built.
