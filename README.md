* eBPF Basics, seccomp filters

### Kernel Debugging Tools

* QEMU + GDB + Pwndbg
* ftrace, kprobes, crash

### 🔧 Projects

* Write an LKM Rootkit (for learning)
* Vulnerable Kernel Module for Training
* Custom Kernel Syscall (e.g., Stealthy Logger)

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Fusion & Adversary Simulation

**Goal**: Blend kernel and offensive skills into elite-level adversary simulation.

### Advanced Red Teaming

* Custom Implants, C2 Development
* AV/EDR Evasion (via kernel-level techniques)
* In-Memory Execution (Reflective Injection)
* Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Sliver

### Kernel-Level Attacks

* Syscall Hooking, Inline Function Hooking
* Kernel Panic Induction & Recovery
* DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation)

### Blue Team Awareness

* Detecting LKM Rootkits
* Kernel Hardening Techniques
* Patch Diffing & CVE Reproduction

### 🔧 Projects

* LKM-based Keylogger with Stealth Detection Bypass

---

## 🏗️ Phase 5: Mastery & Elite Contributions

**Goal**: Contribute to open source, present research, build reputation.

### Real-World Integration

* Contribute to the Linux Kernel (Security Modules, Bug Fixes)
* Create Tools for Red Team Community (with kernel spin)
* Capture the Flag (CTFs with kernel challenges)
* Write & Publish Technical Research / Blogs

### Final Badge-Worthy Projects

* Offensive Kernel Security Framework
* Adversary Simulation Lab in QEMU
