#  👾 RedKernel Offensive Security Master Roadmap

Welcome to my transformation into an **Offensive Kernel Security Engineer**. This is more than a roadmap—it's the forging of a cyber weapon through deep system mastery, red team precision, and relentless lab work. My primary hypervisor for this journey is **Proxmox VE**.

## 🩸 Phase 1: Foundational Blood

**Books:**
- Linux Basics for Hackers
- Network Basics for Hackers
- Gray Hat Hacking (1st Edition)
- Black Hat Bash

**Projects:**
- Setup Proxmox VMs: Kali Linux + Ubuntu targets
- Bash recon scripts
- Manual reverse shell implementation
- Customize `.bashrc` for speed and stealth

**Skills:**
- Linux internals, TCP/IP stack, Bash scripting, buffer overflow intro

---

## 🔬 Phase 2: System Exploiter

**Books:**
- Gray Hat Hacking (3rd & 4th Editions)
- Practical Binary Analysis
- Black Hat Python
- Rootkits and Bootkits

**Projects:**
- Write a custom fuzzer in Python
- Stack/heap exploit development
- Use `gdb`, `pwndbg`, `Ghidra`, and `radare2` on ELF binaries
- Create a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) rootkit for Linux
- Build Python-based C2 implants

**Lab Enhancements:**
- Proxmox snapshot system for Windows targets
- Debuggable custom Linux kernels for syscall/driver testing

---

## 🧬 Phase 3: Ghost in the Kernel

**Books:**
- Gray Hat Hacking (5th–7th Editions)
- Practical Malware Analysis
- Windows Security Internals
- How to Hack Like a Ghost

**Projects:**
- Write custom syscall hijackers
- Build a stealth API-hooking LKM
- Cloud attack lab (AWS/GCP testbed)
- Develop a personal C2 framework in Python
- Simulate APT campaigns: Evasion, lateral movement, privilege escalation

---

## 🧪 Proxmox Offensive Lab Blueprint

**Hardware:**
- 32GB+ RAM, SSD storage, Proxmox VE installed

**Lab Components:**
- **Attacker VMs:** Kali Linux, Commando VM
- **Target VMs:** Windows 10, Windows Server, Ubuntu, custom kernel Linux
- **Containers (LXC):** Lightweight HTTP servers, DNS spoofing zones
- **Snapshots & Clones:** For PoC testing, exploit replay, and rollback

**Essential Tools:**
- Ghidra, radare2, gdb, pwndbg, AFL, Volatility, Wireshark, Sysinternals
- Custom-built fuzzers, rootkits, privilege escalation scripts

## 🧠 Vision

> "I’m not here to follow tools. I’m here to *become* the tool—operating at the intersection of kernel security and red team offense."

Follow my journey as I build a fortress of skills from metal to memory.
