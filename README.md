# 🛡️ Offensive Kernel Security Roadmap | Red Team x Kernel Expert

Welcome to the **Ultimate Hybrid Roadmap**: A fusion of **Kernel Security Engineering** and **Red Team Offensive Security**. This path is curated for those who want to break, understand, and harden systems at the **deepest level**. You'll learn networking, OS internals, programming, exploit development, and kernel defense.
